### 🧠 About Me

I'm a back-end engineer with a solid background in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, and in the past few years, I've been working with **Go**, **Java**, and **Python** as well.

I'm especially curious about **software architecture**, **design principles**, and **how code evolves with teams and products**. I believe building software isn't just about writing code — it's about understanding the product, collaborating on the process, and solving the right problems.

Recently, I started studying **front-end** and **mobile development** (React and React Native — beginner level), so if you explore my repositories, you might find some projects with rough UI or design — all part of the learning process!

### 💡 Philosophy & Approach

I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code that lasts. I embrace testing, continuous learning, and craftsmanship principles to build software that solves real problems — not just code that runs.

Familiar with Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and event-driven systems. I enjoy applying design patterns that promote scalability and maintainability.

Advocate for Agile methodologies, DevOps culture, and automated CI/CD pipelines to deliver value quickly and reliably.

I have experience teaching programming in social projects, and also mentoring in a corporate Talent Development program — helping to structure training, form new programmers across multiple languages, and develop new mentors.
